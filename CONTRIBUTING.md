# Contributing To Terranova Engine

## Getting Started
**Step one:**  
Become a contributor of this project by contacting Ryan via:

>ryan@werescape.com

You will receive a developer key that you will need to put into a text file and save it as 
_dev.key_ in to the viewers main folder where the executable is located 
(in the root directory).

Due to security systems in place, the Universe system will not allow a viewer to 
access or login to the service if it doesn't pass various checks, so unless you have 
been granted a developer key which is associated to the hardware of your device, 
you will not be able to login.

 If you plan to use more then one device or you have replaced hardware in your device 
 that has gotten you locked out, please contact Ryan for additional developer keys. 
 There is no need to worry about loosing data if your hardware has changed, we will 
 update the associations on our end wherever it is needed!

The additional developer key will be provided to you, simply paste it into a text file and 
save it as **_dev.key_** in the base folder with the executable. Developer keys are 
device restricted and can only be used with a single device, each additional device will 
require it's own developer key.

Go ahead and download the development viewer which runs the modules and libraries 
from this project:

**Step two:**  
We will then invite you to our Asana team, once you have joined as a contributor.  
Asana is our project management platform. Once invited to our Asana team you can 
use the following link to get to the Terranova Engine project on Asana:

>https://app.asana.com/0/176332491475110/list

Using Asana we can easily track what needs to be done, what has been done and who is 
working on what or who has done work on things. In order to be a contributor of this 
open source project you must be willing to use Asana, trust me, it's easy and makes life 
so much better!
